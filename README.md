# sagemaker-xgboost-with-hpo
Example of using the XGBoost in-built SageMaker algorithm for a binary classification on tabular data

The example includes:
- Setting up an environment
- Downloading a dataset
- Preparing the dataset
- Uplodading the dataset to S3
- Setting up SageMaker XGBoost algorithm
- Initiating training of a binary classifier
- Deploying the classifier to an enpoint for realtime predictions.
- Evalute the deployed classifier.
- Set up a Hyperparameter optimization job.
- Find the optimal hyperparameters for the classifier.
- Deploy the optimal classifier
- Compare the optimal classifier with the non-optimal onle.
